# **HTML and CSS Projects**

## **Introduction**

Recently, I have completed 8 projects using HTML and CSS to improve my web design skills. Currently, I have finished 4 projects and deployed them on Github. However, those projects lack responsive design to fit different devices. I will continue to develop my skills to improve those projects in the future.

## **Completed Projects**

Below are the projects that I have completed and deployed on Github:

1. **[Real Estate Landing Page (Easy)](https://namdh03.github.io/f8-project-01/):** A website introducing real estate services. I used HTML and CSS to create a beautiful and intuitive interface.

2. **[Education Platform Website (Easy)](https://namdh03.github.io/f8-project-02/):** A website introducing an online education platform. I used HTML and CSS to create the layout and CSS to create beautiful effects.

## **Conclusion**

These projects have helped me improve my web design skills. However, I still need to develop and perfect the projects to make them responsive and more user-friendly. I will continue to learn and practice to become a professional web designer.
